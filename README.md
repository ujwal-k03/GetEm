# GetEm -ðŸ”« One bot to stop 'em all!
## Setup instructions
1. Clone the github repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Create a bot using the following steps:
   - https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot
   - https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html
   - https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/#using-dotenv
3. In the above steps, make sure to give the bot the following permissions:
   - `Kick Members`
   - `Read Messages/View Channels`
   - `Send Messages`
   - `Manage Messages`
   - `Read Message History`
4. Invite the bot to your server.
5. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following variables
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` : Your bot's secret login token.
   - `CLIENT_ID` : The client id of the bot.
   - `GUILD_ID` : The guildId of the guild in which you want to test the bot.
   - `DB_URI` : Your MongoDB database connection URI.

Voila! You are done setting up the client!

## Features

### Strong regex implementation
The bot uses Javascript's own regex based pattern matching to deliver blazing fast results. Never let anyone get away with anything.

### Multi-server deployment
The bot is extremely scalable as it uses a Document oriented database MongoDB as a backend.
Each servers configuration is stored in a single document using it's `guildId`. This makes database queries fast and efficient.
Also, the bot can be turned on and off for maintainance and will 'remember' everything.

### Filter only select channels
Want to filter only a few rowdy channels while leaving every other channel untouched? No problem! Just use the `set-active-channels` command to select
one or more channels for the bot to work it's magic on.

### Role immunity
Want to give a few people the ability to say whatever they want? Want to exempt them from the wrath of the bot? No problem! Just use the `set-exempt-roles` command to select
one or more roles to remain unfiltered.

### Cleanup escaped spam
Did someone manage to escape all your regex checks? Improvise, Adapt, Overcome. Add the new entries using the `add-regex` command and then use the `remove-spam` command 
to cleanup escaped spam.

### Awesome logging system
Every action the bot takes can be logged, unless you prefer otherwise.

### Self handling channel and role deletes
Did you delete one your Active Channels or a Mod Role and forget to update the bot configuration? No worries all this is handled by the bot 
to ensure errorless and smooth running
